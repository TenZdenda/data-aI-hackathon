## About Branda :memo:
#### Do you wonder what they are talking about, when you are offline? </br> And can you predict their reaction on your next post? </br> Branda has solution. Branda knows and she can tell you.
Branda is an autonomous web application which is monitoring social media and various website activities and predicting solutions and possible threats to the company. Branda will report immediate threats and inadequate responses to company’s posts. As a threat we consider for example negative review in comment with more than 100 interactions. With Branda’s unique features any company on social media can consider it as another shield against cyber-attacks. Those attacks could be for example Troll farms whose task is to spread disinformation and cause damage to the company.
Branda has ability to collect data from various social media through hashtags, comments and reactions. </br>
